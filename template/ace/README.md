Ace v3.0.0
---

Thank you for purchasing Ace admin template.  

Basic files inside `node_modules` folder are included to view the demo.  
For full functionality and to customize CSS and JS files, you should run `npm install` to install required tools, libraries, frameworks, etc...  

You may also need to install `git` if you see an error like this:  
```
npm ERR! code ENOENT
npm ERR! syscall spawn git
```


Then you can:  
* Open `index.html`
* Or run `PORT=6000 node index.js` and then open `http://localhost:6000/`


Also *make sure* to removed unwanted features and build a custom **ace.css** as described in documentation.
